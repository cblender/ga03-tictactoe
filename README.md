### Coding:

Tic Tac Toe is a simple JavaScript UI project. It relies on DOM functionality to operate. The HTML handles overall page structure, while the JavaScript handles logical operations and passes data to various HTML elements through the DOM. It also makes use of dynamic CSS styling to seamlessly apply images and other formatting as part of the game functionality.

### How to Play:

Upon opening the page, the user can specify two player names, and then conduct a series of Tic Tac Toe matches between the two players. Realtime directions and status information is displayed for ease of use. The history of wins, losses, and draws is displayed on the page.
